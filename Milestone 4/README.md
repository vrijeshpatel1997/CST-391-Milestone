**Design Report**

This design report provides an overview of the design and key features of my milestone Angular CRUD Product application. The application allows users to manage products by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The design updates aim to enhance functionality, user experience, and maintainability.

**1. Front-end Framework and Libraries**
- Angular: The application is built using the Angular framework, which provides a robust structure for developing scalable and maintainable web applications.

**2. User Interface**
- Material Design: The application utilizes Angular Material components, such as `MatToolbar`, `MatFormField`, `MatIconModule`, `MatButtonModule`, `MatDialog`, `MatInputModule`, `MatTable`, `MatSort`, and `MatPaginator`, to achieve a modern and visually appealing user interface. These components offer a consistent and intuitive design language.

**3. Components**
- `AppComponent`: This component serves as the main component of the application and is responsible for coordinating the interaction between various UI elements and services. It handles the display of the product table, filter functionality, opening the product add/edit dialog, and calling the relevant methods from the `ProductService`.

- `ProductAddEditComponent`: This component represents the dialog for adding or editing a product. It utilizes the Angular Material `MatDialog` component to provide a user-friendly and consistent interface for managing product data. The component includes form controls for capturing product details and communicates with the `ProductService` to perform the respective CRUD operations.

**4. Services**
- `ProductService`: This service is responsible for handling HTTP requests to interact with the backend API for product management. It provides methods for adding, retrieving, deleting, and editing products. The service utilizes the `HttpClient` module for making HTTP requests and communicates with the backend API endpoints to perform the required operations.

**5. Data Management**
- `MatTableDataSource`: The `dataSource` variable is an instance of `MatTableDataSource`, which is used to store and manipulate the product data. It provides functionalities for sorting, filtering, and pagination, which are essential for efficient data presentation and interaction.

**6. Form Handling**
- Reactive Forms: The application utilizes Angular's reactive forms approach, facilitated by the `ReactiveFormsModule`. This approach provides a powerful and flexible way to handle form inputs, validations, and data binding. The `ProductAddEditComponent` uses reactive forms to capture and validate the product data before submitting it to the backend.

**7. HTTP Communication**
- `HttpClientModule`: The application imports and utilizes the `HttpClientModule` to make HTTP requests to the backend API. This module provides the necessary functionalities for sending requests and receiving responses.

**Known Issues**
- No validation or error handling for form inputs: The application currently lacks validation and error handling for form inputs, such as ensuring the correctness of numeric values and displaying appropriate error messages.
- Potential accessibility improvements: The application may benefit from further accessibility enhancements, such as providing labels for form inputs, to ensure a better user experience for individuals with disabilities.
